Vectors (`Vec`) are **variable-length arrays**. They are the most common type of **collection** you will use day-to-day.

A vector consists of a **length**, a **capacity**, and a **pointer**. A vector's pointer points to heap-allocated memory _only if_ both its capacity is nonzero and the element size is nonzero. Elements of a vector are always allocated to the heap.

As a vector grows beyond its capacity it will need to reallocate to a larger heap allocation. Rust automatically frees the previously-used heap allocation of the vector.

### Creating vectors

You can create a vector a number of ways. The most common way is using the `vec!` macro:

<Code language="rust">let cars = vec!["BMW", "Mercedes", "Fiat"];</Code>
You can use the `Vec::new` or `Vec::default` methods to create a vector with a length
and capacity of zero, or the `Vec::with_capacity` method to create an empty vector
with _at least_ the specified capacity.

<Code language="rust">

let empty_vector = Vec::new(); // an empty vector
let min_cap_vector = Vec::with_capacity(10); // with a minumum capacity of 10

</Code>

### Querying vectors

Check the length of a vector with `len`:

<Code language="rust">

let friends = vec!["Jessi", "Andrew", "Nick"];
assert_eq!(friends.len(), 3);

</Code>

Check the if a vector is empty with `is_empty`:

<Code language="rust">
```
let no_friends: Vec<&str> = Vec::new();
assert!(no_friends.is_empty());
```
</Code>

Get the first element of a vector with `first`:

<Code language="rust">

let friends = vec!["Jessi", "Andrew", "Nick"];
let jessi = friends.first();
assert_eq!(jessi, Some(&"Jessi"));

</Code>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘‰">If the vector is empty, this will return `None`</Callout>

### Modifying vectors

You can **add** and **remove** elements to the end a vector using the `push` and `pop` methods, respectively:

<Code language="rust">

let mut friends = Vec::new();
assert!(friends.is_empty());
friends.push("Jessi");
friends.push("Andrew");
assert_eq!(friends, ["Jessi", "Andrew"]);
friends.pop();
assert_eq!(friends, ["Jessi"]);

</Code>

You can also **insert** an element at an arbitrary position in a vector using `insert`:

<Code language="rust">

let mut friends = vec!["Jessi", "Devin", "Missy"];
friends.insert(1, "Lola");
assert_eq!(friends, ["Jessi", "Lola", "Devin", "Missy"]);

</Code>

You can **move** elements from one vector to another using the `append` method, effectively attaching the start of one vector to the end of another. Note: this leaves the other vector empty:

<Code language="rust">

let mut friends = vec!["Jessi", "Lola", "Missy"];
let mut more_friends = vec!["Nick", "Andrew"];
friends.append(&mut more_friends);
assert_eq!(friends, ["Jessi", "Lola", "Missy", "Nick", "Andrew"]);
assert!(more_friends.is_empty()); // other vector is now empty

</Code>

Remove _consecutive_ duplicates from a vector using `dedup`:

<Code language="rust">

let mut friends = vec!["Jessi", "Andrew", "Andrew", "Nick"];
friends.dedup();
assert_eq!(friends, ["Jessi", "Andrew", "Nick"]);

</Code>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘‰">
  Note that this only removes _consecutive_ duplicates. Consider using the
  `sort` method before `dedup` if your vector is not sorted.
</Callout>

You can shorten a vector using the `truncate` method, which keeps all elements up to (but not including) the supplied index:

<Code language="rust">

let friends = vec!["Jessi", "Andrew", "Nick"];
friends.truncate(2);
assert_eq!(friends, ["Jessi", "Andrew"];

</Code>

Use `drain` to remove a specified range from a vector and return it as an iterator. If the iterator is dropped before being consumed the dropped newly-created iterator is dropped.

<Code language="rust">
```
let friends = vec!["Jessi", "Andrew", "Nick"];
let boys: Vec<\_> = friends.drain(1..).collect();
assert_eq!(boys, ["Andrew", "Nick"]);
assert_eq!(friends, ["Jessi"]);
```
</Code>

If you initially create a vector with a larger capacity than necessary, you can shrink the vector with a lower bound using `shink_to_fit`:

<Code language="rust">

let friends = Vec::with_capacity(10); // an empty vector with a minumum capacity of 10
friends.extend(["Jessi", "Andrew", "Nick"]);
assert_eq!(friends.capacity(), 10); friends.shink_to_fit(); // shink vector capacity to fit vector length
assert_eq!(friends.capacity(), >= 3);

</Code>

### Removing vector elements

The simplest way to remove all elements from a vector is using `clear` method:

<Code language="rust">

let friends = vec!["Jessi", "Andrew", "Nick"];
assert_eq!(friends.len(), 3);
friends.clear();
assert!(friends.is_empty());

</Code>

This is the same as calling `truncate` with a length of `0`:

<Code language="rust">

friends.truncate(0);
assert!(friends.is_empty());

</Code>

Or `drain` with an full range:

<Code language="rust">

friends.drain(..);
assert!(friends.is_empty());

</Code>

You can use `remove` to remove and return a single element of an array, preserving the order of the array:

<Code language="rust">

let mut friends = vec!["Jessi", "Andrew", "Nick"];
let andrew = friends.remove(1);
assert_eq!(andrew, "Andrew");

</Code>
