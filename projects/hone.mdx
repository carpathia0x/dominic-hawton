### About

Hone is a liquid staking platform built on the Algorand blockchain. Owners of Algorand's ALGO token can use their tokens to participate in key governance decisions for the Algorand network. In return, they receive additional ALGO for participating. To be eligible, ALGO holders commit to keeping their ALGO in their wallet for the duration of the three-month governance period, as well as vote in any votes that arise during this period. This means that if users wanted to borrow against their ALGO (i.e. use it as collateral), they would have to forgo governance rewards.

Hone provides a way to both capture governance yield and use the underlying value of the ALGO participating in governance. Prior to a governance period, users can deposit their ALGO into Hone's Staking Pool smart contract and will receive dALGO, a token that represents their pro-rata share of the ALGO in the pool. dALGO can then be used as collateral for loans, traded freely, or passively held without the need for direct governance participation, all the while accruing governance rewards in the form of additional ALGO.
